The **HR Administration** app is an early-stage concept designed to give agencies a standardized way to manage personnel actions, requests, and workforce events. Built on Microsoft Power Platform, the app brings together the data and processes needed for day-to-day HR administration—helping agencies increase transparency, maintain compliance, and provide better support for employees.

The current baseline consists of a **model-driven app** with a sitemap and starter forms for key entities such as **Person, HR Position, HR Position Assignment, HR Change Request, HR Personnel Action, HR Time Off Request, HR Telework Request, HR Disciplinary Action, HR Reasonable Accommodation, and HR Event**. Together, these entities create the foundation for recording official position details, documenting personnel actions, and managing the wide variety of requests employees submit over the course of their careers.

Looking ahead, the app is envisioned to provide agencies with an integrated view of their workforce. Managers could use it to review telework, overtime, and leave requests alongside an employee’s current position and assignment. HR offices could initiate and track personnel actions such as reassignments, promotions, or disciplinary measures, ensuring that each is properly categorized, documented, and linked to organizational impacts. Sensitive processes like reasonable accommodation requests could be handled securely while still maintaining traceability. Over time, analytics and dashboards could provide insights into staffing patterns, workforce gaps, and the downstream effects of personnel actions.

The app could also extend to support workforce planning, using position descriptions, job series, and grade/rank information to analyze staffing needs and guide realignment decisions.

Because the HR Administration app is still in an early stage of development, its current functionality is limited to shell forms and navigation. However, the underlying data model lays the groundwork for a comprehensive personnel administration solution that agencies can expand and adapt to fit their specific processes.
