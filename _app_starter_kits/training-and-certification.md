The **Training and Certification** app provides agencies with a structured framework for managing courses, classes, certifications, and participant achievements. Built on Microsoft Power Platform, the app helps agencies organize training programs, track enrollee participation, and maintain certification records, ensuring that workforce development and compliance requirements are met.

The model-driven app includes areas for both **Enrollment and Attendance** and **Setup**. In the enrollment side, agencies can manage **Persons, Training Course Enrollees, Training Class Enrollees, Training Class Attendees, and Training Achievements**, giving staff and supervisors visibility into who has enrolled, who attended, and what certifications or achievements were earned. On the setup side, administrators can define **Training Objectives, Training Instructors, Training Courses, Training Certificates, and Training Classes**, providing a comprehensive structure for creating, delivering, and evaluating training opportunities.

The app supports a variety of training management functions. Agencies can define course objectives and track metrics against them, assign instructors, and record course details including purpose, syllabus, prerequisites, logistics, and accreditation. Courses can be tied to certificates and scheduled into classes, each with its own roster of enrollees and attendees. Certifications earned can be linked back to courses and tracked against participants to demonstrate compliance with training mandates.

Beyond the core app, an alternative model-driven app, **Government Academy**, is also available, tailored more specifically to institutions offering courses to external students or prospective applicants. This provides agencies with flexibility to choose the structure best suited to their audience.

Looking ahead, the Training and Certification app is well-positioned to grow with additional features such as dashboards for tracking course completion rates, integration with learning management systems, and workflows to automate reminders and renewals for certifications. Agencies could also extend it to support specialized scenarios like mandatory compliance training, professional development programs, or technical certification paths.

By unifying courses, classes, instructors, enrollees, and achievements into a single system, the Training and Certification app provides agencies with a reusable, auditable framework for workforce development. It ensures that training requirements are met, certifications are documented, and institutional knowledge is strengthened over time.
