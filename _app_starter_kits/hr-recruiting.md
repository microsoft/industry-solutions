The **HR Recruiting** app is an early-stage concept designed to give agencies a standardized framework for managing the hiring lifecycle. Built on Microsoft Power Platform, the app provides the foundational structure for tracking job postings, candidates, and applications, helping agencies reduce reliance on spreadsheets and disconnected tools while creating a reusable framework for government hiring processes.

The current baseline consists of a **model-driven app** with a sitemap and starter forms for entities such as **HR Job Posting, HR Candidate, and HR Application**. Together, these tables establish the essential relationships between open positions, the applicants who apply, and the applications submitted for consideration. This structure allows agencies to track postings, manage applicant pools, and monitor the status of applications through each step of the process.

Looking ahead, the app is envisioned to grow into a more complete recruiting solution. Agencies could expand it with additional components for **assessments, interviews, selection panels, and onboarding workflows**, ensuring compliance with government hiring rules while tailoring the process to their internal practices. Dashboards could highlight open positions, track time-to-fill metrics, and provide visibility into candidate pipelines. Over time, the app could integrate with **HR Administration** to enable a seamless transition from hiring into position assignments, personnel actions, and employee records.

Potential use cases include small HR offices tracking postings and applications in a lightweight system, as well as larger agencies building out a more robust recruiting environment with assessments and automated workflows. Whether for high-volume applicant pools or specialized hiring campaigns, the HR Recruiting app offers a foundation that agencies can adapt and expand to meet their needs.

Because the app is still in an early stage of development, its current functionality is limited to shell forms and navigation. However, the underlying data model provides a solid starting point for agencies to modernize recruiting processes, improve compliance and transparency, and better manage the journey from job posting to hire.
