The **Executive Coordination** app provides government agencies with a structured platform for managing **Executive Actions**, the formal taskers that drive agency-wide implementation of high-level directives. Built on Microsoft’s Power Platform, the app helps agencies establish a consistent, auditable framework for turning executive orders, congressional mandates, policy directives, and other formal communications into coordinated actions with measurable outcomes.

The process typically begins in the **Legal Authorities** area, where agencies capture and review incoming mandates or other governing documents. Here, users can log executive orders, congressional mandates, or agency directives, record amendments, and track cross-references to related authorities. These records serve as the source material for Executive Actions, enabling agencies to trace every tasker back to its original authority. Generative AI tools such as the **Legal Authority Analyzer** further accelerate this intake process by summarizing lengthy legal texts and identifying potential departmental impacts or risks.

Once an authority has been reviewed, agencies can create **Executive Actions** to define an implementation plan. Each Executive Action can include milestones, assigned responsibilities, and supporting documentation, providing a central hub for tracking agency progress. The app also includes flexible tools for managing **analyses, risks, and impacts**, giving leadership visibility into challenges that may affect completion. At the core of execution are **Action Items**, which can be created from templates or entered ad hoc, then assigned to teams or individuals with due dates and status tracking. A side-pane interface allows staff to update progress quickly without losing context, making task management simple and transparent.

Beyond mandate-driven taskers, the app can also support **Correspondence Management**. Many executive secretary offices, front offices, and executive secretariat functions must receive, log, route, and track letters, memos, and other forms of correspondence that require official action. By leveraging the same Executive Action framework, the app allows agencies to ensure correspondence is acknowledged, assigned, and resolved in a timely, traceable way.

Agencies could apply the app in several scenarios: coordinating the rollout of a new executive order across multiple bureaus; tracking compliance activities related to a congressional mandate; assigning implementation responsibilities for agency-wide policy changes; or logging and resolving high-level correspondence requiring executive attention. In all of these cases, the **Executive Coordination** app provides a single system of record that improves accountability, enhances transparency, and reduces the administrative burden of managing complex, high-stakes taskers.
