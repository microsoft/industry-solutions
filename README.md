# FAST - Flexible Application Solution Templates

This repository is an open-source ecosystem for building enterprise applications on Microsoft Power Platform and Dynamics 365. It provides reusable, modular building blocks that help organizations deliver solutions more quickly and with greater consistency.

**FAST** stands for **Flexible Application Solution Templates**, and each module includes standardized data models, prebuilt applications, comprehensive documentation, and release packages — all available under the MIT license.

This documentation site serves as the hub for the **[FAST Modules Repository](https://github.com/microsoft/industry-apps)**, which contains the source code, releases, and contribution guidelines.

Whether you're in public sector, healthcare, education, manufacturing, or any other industry, **FAST** gives you a proven foundation to accelerate solution delivery while maintaining flexibility to tailor applications to your specific needs.

## 🎯 Modular, Flexible, Industry-Ready

The modules in this repository are designed as a layered, composable foundation that works across industries:

- **Modules** provide complete, ready-to-deploy solutions with data models, forms, views, dashboards, automation, and business logic for common business processes like asset management, case tracking, project management, and more.

- **Modular design** means you can deploy individual modules independently or combine them to build more comprehensive solutions.

- **Standardized data models** ensure consistency and interoperability, making it easier to integrate modules with each other and with external systems.

- **Industry-agnostic patterns** support common business processes found across sectors, with the flexibility to extend and customize for industry-specific requirements.

Benefits of this modular approach:

- **Faster time to value** – Start with working solutions instead of building from scratch
- **Lower risk** – Build on tested, documented patterns rather than reinventing common capabilities
- **Easier maintenance** – Modular architecture means changes to one component don't cascade through the entire system
- **Better reusability** – Share modules across different projects and teams
- **Clearer governance** – Each module can have its own lifecycle while remaining compatible with the ecosystem

## 📌 Intended Use

The modules in this repository are provided as **reference implementations** for learning, experimentation, and as a starting point for building production-ready applications.

They are **not** designed to be deployed directly to a production environment without additional development, testing, and validation. Any organization planning to use these modules in production should:

* Adapt and extend the solutions to meet specific business and technical requirements
* Integrate them into the organization’s **Application Lifecycle Management (ALM)** processes
* Perform full **security, compliance, and performance reviews**
* Apply updates, fixes, and enhancements as needed

These modules are meant to accelerate solution design and reduce initial build time, but the responsibility for ensuring readiness, compliance, and ongoing maintenance lies with the implementing organization.
