We're excited to announce significant updates to the **Asset Management** module with the release of **Data Model v1.1.0.0** and **App Starter Kit v1.2.0.0**. These coordinated releases expand asset tracking capabilities and deliver a redesigned user interface for more efficient government property management.

## Enhanced Data Model v1.1.0.0

The updated data model adds essential fields to the Asset entity, enabling agencies to track assets throughout their complete lifecycle:

**Status Tracking**: New Asset Status choice field with lifecycle values including In Transit, In Storage, Awaiting Assignment, Issued, Under Maintenance, Lost/Stolen, Retired, Pending Disposition, and Disposed.

**Multiple Identification Methods**: Support for serial numbers, service tags, and RF tags provides flexible asset identification to accommodate different tracking technologies and organizational needs.

**Financial Management**: Unit cost and quantity fields enable cost tracking and budget oversight for asset valuation and procurement planning.

**Organizational Assignment**: Organization Unit lookup field establishes clear institutional responsibility and assignment tracking.

**Location Management**: Location lookup with notes and inventory date fields supports detailed placement tracking and audit trail maintenance.

## Redesigned User Interface v1.2.0.0

The app starter kit features a completely redesigned Asset form with organized tab structure and logical field grouping:

**Four-Tab Organization**: 
- **Asset Overview**: Identification fields, classification, and status information
- **Financials**: Acquisition dates, costs, currency, and procurement tracking  
- **Ownership & Location**: Assignment, location details, and inventory management
- **Notes**: Dedicated space for additional asset information

**Assets Overview Dashboard**: New simple dashboard providing quick visibility into assets by category and status, plus an active assets list view.

## Improved Workflows

These updates work together to support common government asset management scenarios:

- **IT Equipment**: Track laptops and devices with serial numbers, assign to users through organizational units, and monitor status from procurement through retirement
- **Fleet Management**: Manage vehicles with service tags, track maintenance status, and maintain location assignments with detailed notes  
- **Facilities Assets**: Monitor building systems and equipment with cost tracking, scheduled inventory dates, and organizational responsibility

The enhanced data model provides the foundation for accurate asset tracking, while the redesigned interface organizes information logically for faster data entry and better user experience.

Both releases are available now and work together to provide government agencies with improved tools for asset stewardship and inventory management.
