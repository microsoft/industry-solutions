Ho ho ho! 🎅 While everyone else is wrapping presents and planning holiday parties, we've been wrapping up our very first portal release. Consider it an early holiday gift to the government development community...

## Introducing the Core Portal

We're excited to announce the release of **Core Portal v1.0.0.0**. This is our inaugural entry into the portal space, and like that first batch of holiday cookies that's slightly burned around the edges, it's a solid starting point with plenty of room for you to add your own magic.

## What's Under the Tree

The Core Portal delivers the essentials - think of it as the government equivalent of getting socks for Christmas. Not flashy, but absolutely necessary:

- **USWDS Identification Banner** - Because compliance is the gift that keeps on giving
- **Header with Search Bar** - For when you need to find something (like where you put that important document)
- **Navigation Menu Framework** - The bones are there, you just need to add the meat
- **Footer** - Every good story needs an ending
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop, tablet, and phone

The Core Portal provides the structural scaffolding that follows USWDS standards, so you can focus on adding the functionality your agency actually needs instead of figuring out CSS Grid layouts at 2 AM.

<div style="border: 2px solid #ddd; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; display: inline-block;">
  <img src="{{ 'assets/portals/core/core-portal-shell.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Core Portal Shell" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

## What's Next

After the holiday food coma wears off, we'll be working on additional portal features and enhancements. Think of this release as the appetizer - the main course is still in development.

In the meantime, if you decide to take the Core Portal for a spin during your holiday break, we'd love to hear your feedback.
