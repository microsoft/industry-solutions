We're pleased to announce **Process and Tasking App v1.1.1.0**, a minor release delivering targeted user experience improvements.

## What's New

This update includes three focused enhancements:

- **Enhanced Action Item Management**: Replaced single Action Item view with comprehensive Action Items custom page for better task visibility
- **Optimized Loading Performance**: Fixed new record loading to prevent displaying all top-level action items, improving page performance  
- **Smarter Side Pane Behavior**: Side pane now opens minimized on new forms while maintaining specified width on existing records

These improvements address common user workflow challenges and enhance overall system responsiveness.
