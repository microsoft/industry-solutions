We're excited to introduce **FAST** — an open-source ecosystem for building enterprise applications on Microsoft Power Platform and Dynamics 365.

## From GLOWS to FAST: Expanding Beyond Government

FAST has evolved from the original Government Low-code Open-source Workforce Solutions (GLOWS) project. While GLOWS successfully provided reusable building blocks for government agencies, we recognized that the same patterns, data models, and applications could benefit organizations across all industries and sectors.

Today, **FAST** brings that same proven foundation to public sector, healthcare, education, manufacturing, and any other industry looking to accelerate solution delivery on the Power Platform.

## What is FAST?

**FAST** provides reusable, modular building blocks that help organizations deliver solutions more quickly and with greater consistency. Each module includes:

- **Standardized data models** that ensure consistency and interoperability
- **Prebuilt applications** with forms, views, dashboards, and automation
- **Comprehensive documentation** to guide deployment and customization
- **Release packages** ready to deploy in your environment

All available under the MIT license from the [FAST Modules Repository](https://github.com/microsoft/industry-apps).

## Built for Real-World Needs

**FAST** modules address common business processes found across industries:

- **Asset Management** – Track, categorize, and manage resources throughout their lifecycle
- **Training and Certification** – Manage training programs, certifications, and compliance tracking
- **Project Tracking** – Manage tasks, milestones, and project deliverables
- **Time & Expense Tracking** – Capture time entries and expense submissions
- **And many more** – With new modules being added regularly

## Why Choose FAST?

### Faster Time to Value
Start with working solutions instead of building from scratch. Deploy a module, customize it to your needs, and start adding value immediately.

### Lower Risk
Build on tested, documented patterns rather than reinventing common capabilities. Each module has been refined through real-world use.

### Easier Maintenance
Modular architecture means changes to one component don't cascade through the entire system. Update what you need, when you need it.

### Better Reusability
Share modules across different projects and teams. Standardized data models make integration straightforward.

### Clearer Governance
Each module can have its own lifecycle while remaining compatible with the ecosystem. Mix and match as your needs evolve.

## Industry-Agnostic, Industry-Ready

While our modules use industry-agnostic patterns, they're designed to be easily extended for industry-specific requirements. Whether you need to:

- Adapt asset management for healthcare equipment tracking
- Customize case management for legal or compliance workflows
- Extend project tracking for construction or engineering projects

**FAST** provides the foundation, and you bring the industry expertise.
