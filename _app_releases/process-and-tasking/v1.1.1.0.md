This release improves the user experience with enhanced action item management, optimized form loading behavior, and better side pane functionality for more efficient workflow operations.

-   **Person (Contact)**
    - **Person - Process and Tasking Form**: Removed Action Item custom page on load and replaced with improved Action Items functionality for better performance and user experience.

-   **Action Items (Custom Page)**
    - **Loading Optimization**: Fixed loading behavior from new records to prevent displaying all top-level action items, improving page load performance and focusing on relevant content.

-   **Process and Tasking (JavaScript)**
    - **Side Pane Enhancement**: Improved side pane loading behavior - opens as minimized on new forms for better initial view, while maintaining specified width on existing records for optimal workspace utilization.
