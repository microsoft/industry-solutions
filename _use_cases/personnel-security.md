## Overview

Personnel Security covers the policies, processes, and technical controls that ensure the right people are granted the right access for the right reasons—and that access is continuously validated and removed when no longer required. This includes background investigations and clearances, role-based access provisioning, continuous monitoring of privileged activity, and robust offboarding to protect sensitive information, mission continuity, and organizational trust.

- Mission scenarios: onboarding staff and contractors with sensitive access; provisioning privileged accounts for mission-critical systems; responding to suspected insider threats or clearance changes.  
- Importance: reduces insider risk, enables least-privilege enforcement, supports regulatory compliance (e.g., NIST/FISMA guidance), and preserves operational integrity.

## Where Personnel Security is used

Common agency contexts and domains:

- Defense, intelligence, and national security organizations.  
- Law enforcement and public safety agencies.  
- Civilian agencies handling sensitive personally identifiable information (PII), health, or financial data.  
- Agencies that manage contractor workforces or grant-funded programs.  
- IT and operations teams responsible for privileged accounts and critical infrastructure.

## High level processes

Outline of major processes and interacting personas:

- Workforce planning and role definition  
  - Actors: HR Administrator, Hiring Manager, Mission Owner  
  - Define required roles, sensitivity levels, and clearance requirements.

- Pre-employment screening and adjudication  
  - Actors: Security/Personnel Office, Background Investigation Provider  
  - Conduct checks, adjudicate findings, and record eligibility for required roles.

- Onboarding and access provisioning  
  - Actors: Identity/Access Administrator, IT Operations, New Employee/Contractor  
  - Create accounts, assign roles and permissions based on least privilege, deliver required training and policy acknowledgments.

- Authorization and continuous validation  
  - Actors: Security Officer, System Owners, Identity Management  
  - Periodic revalidation of access, certification campaigns, continuous monitoring of anomalous behavior and privileged actions.

- Role changes and transfers  
  - Actors: HR, Identity Admin, Manager  
  - Update access as job duties change; enforce change reviews.

- Offboarding and deprovisioning  
  - Actors: HR, Identity Admin, Facilities  
  - Revoke accounts and credentials, recover assets, ensure timely removal of access and privileges.

- Incident response and adjudication  
  - Actors: Insider Threat Program, Security Operations, Legal/Compliance  
  - Investigate suspicious activity, take corrective action, and update policies or access controls.

## Common needs and challenges

Typical requirements and pain points for agencies:

- Reliable integration between HR systems (HRIS) and identity/access management to support rapid, auditable provisioning and deprovisioning.  
- Automation to enforce least privilege and reduce manual errors for high-volume onboarding and contractor lifecycles.  
- Scalability and timeliness of background investigations and clearance processes.  
- Clear ownership, workflows, and SLAs for access changes and revocations.  
- Continuous monitoring and analytics tailored to detect insider risk and privileged misuse.  
- Maintaining audit trails, evidence for audits, and demonstrable compliance with organizational standards.  
- Balancing privacy and data minimization with investigative and security needs.

## Success measures

Measurable outcomes and KPIs agencies use to evaluate personnel security:

- Mean time to provision compliant access for new hires and contractors.  
- Mean time to deprovision after termination or role change.  
- Percentage of privileged accounts with documented business justification and least-privilege configuration.  
- Rate of completed access recertifications on schedule.  
- Reduction in incidents attributable to insider misuse or improper access.  
- Number and severity of audit findings related to personnel security processes.
